# The Last Unfair Advantage

*Why context—not targeting—is the next frontier in rewards*

---

I was watching *Border* on YouTube—the 1997 Sunny Deol film about the Battle of Longewala, where a hundred and twenty Indian soldiers held a desert outpost against an advancing Pakistani armour column—when a Myntra ad appeared in the lower third of my screen. It was selling a Safari camouflage backpack. The algorithm had matched the keyword: *camo*.

The irony was exquisite, and it was total. Here was a scene depicting men who wore camouflage because they were about to die in it, and here was an e-commerce platform treating that same pattern as a fashion accessory. The algorithm could not distinguish between war as sacrifice and camo as aesthetic. To the machine, both were inventory.

This is a small, absurd example of a problem that runs through the entire rewards and loyalty industry—the industry I have spent the last several years building enterprise solutions for. We have become extraordinarily good at finding the right person and showing them the right product. We have become almost comically bad at understanding the right moment.

You might assume, as I did initially, that such misplacements are at least effective in a cynical, click-through-rate sense. The viewer watching *Border* is likely male, likely patriotic, possibly military-admiring, and therefore psychologically primed to associate camouflage gear with strength. Surely the conversion probability is high?

The research says otherwise. A meta-analysis of fifty-three experiments involving 8,489 participants found that brands advertised alongside violent media content were remembered less often, evaluated less favourably, and purchased less frequently. The common industry assumption that "sex and violence sell" is empirically wrong. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin demonstrated the mechanism: violent content draws attention but diverts it from adjacent information, including advertisements. The viewer is cognitively occupied processing the emotional payload of the scene. The backpack never had a chance.

This is not a niche finding. It is one of the most replicated results in advertising psychology, and yet the programmatic ad industry continues to serve impressions into hostile emotional environments because the targeting parameters check out. Male. India. Lifestyle and outdoor interests. The system found the right audience. It missed everything else.

I sell rewards platforms for a living. I build the systems that decide which offer a customer sees when they open an app or scan a receipt or tap a loyalty card. The fundamental architecture of every rewards programme I have encountered—whether for an automobile manufacturer, a pharmaceutical company, a shopping mall, or a bank—is built around two axes: *who* is the customer, and *what* should we offer them.

The segmentation is often sophisticated. We slice customers by purchase history, demographics, vehicle model, spending tier, geographic cluster. We know that the Kia EV6 owner is not the Kia Sonet owner and should not receive the same dining voucher. We know that the Abbott Ensure buyer and the Abbott PediaSure buyer have different household profiles. We know that the DLF Mall shopper in Noida and the DLF Mall shopper in Chennai respond to different festival calendars. None of this is trivial. It is real, useful intelligence.

But it is incomplete. Because even the most precisely targeted offer, delivered at the wrong emotional moment, is worse than no offer at all. A spa voucher pushed to a customer who just had a service complaint is tone-deaf. A luxury watch discount served during a debt-consolidation search is grotesque. A birthday reward delivered three days late is an insult dressed as generosity.

> *The right product, the right audience, the wrong moment. That is the default condition of the modern rewards industry.*

What would it mean to build a rewards system that understood context? Not just *who* the customer is and *what* they might want, but *when* they are ready to want it—and, more importantly, when they are not.

Context-aware rewards would require three layers of intelligence that most platforms currently lack. The first is *emotional state inference*—not the crude sentiment analysis of a chatbot, but a probabilistic model that estimates receptivity based on recent interaction patterns. A customer who just filed a complaint is in a different emotional state than one who just redeemed a reward successfully. The former needs resolution, not a coupon.

The second is *temporal appropriateness*. A two-thirty A.M. SMS about loyalty points—which I once received from a restaurant chain in Gurgaon—violates a basic contract of trust. Not because the information is wrong, but because the timing communicates that the brand does not think of you as a person who sleeps. This is not a technology limitation. It is a design failure rooted in the belief that any impression is better than no impression.

The third layer is *narrative coherence*. Every customer is in the middle of a story with your brand, and the next reward you offer should feel like the next sentence in that story, not a non sequitur. If I bought an HP laptop last week, the contextually intelligent move is not to immediately offer me another laptop. It is to offer me something that makes the laptop I already own more valuable—a software subscription, a peripheral, a setup service. The reward should acknowledge where I am in the relationship, not where the inventory needs me to be.

If context-aware rewards are so obviously superior, why does almost nobody build them? The answer is structural. The rewards industry's revenue model is built on volume: impressions served, vouchers distributed, points issued. Context-awareness inherently means showing fewer offers, more selectively. It means sometimes the best action is no action. This is an extremely difficult thing to sell to a brand manager whose KPI is redemption rate.

There is also a measurement problem. We can easily measure what happened when we showed an offer. We cannot easily measure what would have happened if we had waited. The counterfactual—the reward withheld until the right moment—is invisible to standard analytics. And what cannot be measured, in the enterprise software world, does not exist.

But the cost of ignoring context is accumulating. Loyalty programme fatigue is real. The average Indian consumer is enrolled in more than a dozen rewards programmes and actively uses fewer than three. The others have become noise—a background hum of irrelevant offers that train the customer to ignore everything. Each poorly timed notification is a small withdrawal from the trust account. Eventually, the account closes.

I keep thinking about that Myntra ad on the *Border* scene. It was not a failure of targeting. The system correctly identified a male Indian viewer with outdoor lifestyle interests. It was a failure of imagination—the inability to ask a question that algorithms are not yet built to ask: *What is this person feeling right now, and does our product belong in that feeling?*

The rewards industry has spent two decades perfecting the science of *who* and *what*. It has built vast recommendation engines, customer data platforms, and segmentation models that would have seemed like science fiction in 2005. But it has almost entirely neglected *when* and *why now*. This is not a small gap. This is the gap between a rewards programme that a customer tolerates and one that a customer values.

The companies that figure out contextual intelligence in rewards will not just improve their click-through rates. They will build something that the industry has been chasing for twenty years and has never achieved: genuine loyalty. Not the transactional kind, where a customer stays because switching costs are high. The real kind, where a customer stays because the brand consistently demonstrates that it understands not just what they want, but when they want it.

Everyone in this industry is competing for the right product and the right audience. The last unfair advantage is the right moment. And right now, almost nobody is competing for it.

*The bridge is empty. Walk across it.*
